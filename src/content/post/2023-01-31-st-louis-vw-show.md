Details on chassis number 133 2543 365, pulled from the [JBugs VIN Decoder](https://www.jbugs.com/category/vw-vin.html)

We purchased the car in 1994 (maybe 1993?) in Fairfield, California. As far as I know, at the time the car was matching engine/chassis/transmission, but it had been repainted at some point prior to us acquiring it.

### 1973 Super Beetle Key Features:

The Super Beetle has a McPherson strut front suspension. To make this major front suspension change, the Super Beetle features different front body sheet metal including front hood, fenders, apron and quarter panels. The front of the chassis is changed as well to accommodate the new suspension design. The body is the same as Standard Beetle from the "A" pillar back. The chassis is the same as the Standard Beetle from the framehead back. The bumpers, turn signals, headlights and most trim items such as the hood handle are the same as the Standard Beetle.

### MAJOR BODY STYLE CHANGE.

- Larger curved windshield.
- Longer wiper arms and blades.
- Shortened front hood to accommodate larger windshield.
- Aluminum cowl molding added at body line between door jamb and hood.
- Larger "elephant foot" tail light.
- Front seats have wider, more round headrest.
- Larger plastic air cleaner housing with paper element.
- No oil drain plug on oil sump plate.
- Hood emblem removed from top of hood.
- Running board molding narrowed to 10mm.
- Transmission mounts change for less driveline vibration.
- Mid year, externally regulated alternator replaces the generator.
- Special Edition "Sports Bug" offered.
- Last year for thin channel bumpers.

\*\*(All of the above information is standard model information for US spec VW Beetles. VW was always changing the Beetle and often times did so in the midst of any given model year so it is common to see mis-matched components on any given model year.)
