I've always been drawn to the character of the classic VW Beetle, and for years, I owned a unique 1973 VW Super Beetle that stood out wherever it went. It was more than just a car; it was a custom-built piece of my life. This Beetle, painted a strikingly dark blue that leaned towards purple, had a series of customizations that made it unlike any other on the road.

In 2001, I made the tough decision to part ways with it, listing it on eBay. It found a new home with a family in Alton, Illinois. Little did I know, this was the beginning of a years-long mystery as the car embarked on a journey of its own. At some point in the early 2000s, my Beetle found its way up to Fort Drum, New York. I'm not entirely sure of the exact year – I estimate between 2002 and 2003. Unfortunately, without the ability to track its VIN on services like Carfax (it’s too old for that), the details of its journey remain elusive.

This wasn’t your everyday Beetle, and maybe its unique look has helped it stick out in the memories of anyone who’s crossed paths with it. It had fiberglass fenders, custom widened to about 2-3 inches on both the front and rear. The rear tail lights featured two round fixtures on each fender, a detail that gave it a unique look from behind. To top it off, I added a fiberglass panel to cover the exhaust apron, filling in the original cutouts and adding to its distinct silhouette.

I'm reaching out to the community in hopes that someone might have a clue about its whereabouts. Whether it’s tucked away in someone’s garage, sitting in a workshop waiting to be revived, or even spotted at a car show, any information would be invaluable. And maybe, just maybe, I’ll be able to bring this cherished Beetle back home where it belongs.
