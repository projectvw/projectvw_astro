After a couple of years with the website running on Jekyll, I've migrated to a newer website interface built with [Astro.build](https://astro.build). 

All of the existing content has been migrated over, and older images have even been updated with some better "upscaling", through the intricate use of image processing and AI.

Considering I haven't owned or seen the car since 2001, the digital photos I had were all very dated. Through the use of Stable Diffusion I have upscaled some of those images to try to bring out some additional details and quality!

Take a look around, and check out the [contact](/contact) page which is an easy way to reach out!
